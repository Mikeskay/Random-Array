# Random-Array
Write a Java program called RandomArray.java using nested loops that completes the following three methods:  - public void printArray() - This method simply prints out the value of each array element.  - public int calSum() - This method calculates the sum of all values in the array and returns the sum.  - public double calMean() - This method calculates the mean of all values in the array and return the mean. [hint: think about reuse, you should call the method calSum() to get the sum].  It will produce similar output as following:  >java RandomArray 5 9 7 2 1 4 Sum: 23 Mean: 4.6  >java RandomArray 8 0 9 5 3 5 6 0 8 Sum: 36 Mean: 4.5
